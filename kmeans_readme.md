K-means

File name: Kmeans_task.ipynb
An example of a K-means clustering algorithm, an effective unsupervised machine learning method.
Groups data points together without needing target variable(s).
Country-data.csv file must be downloaded and stored in same directory as this ipynb file for the code to execute.
Installations required to run: python3, jupyter notebook, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Correlations between many variables;
